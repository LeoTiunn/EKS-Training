# Setup

To get started with this class you will need [git](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git).  Then you can clone this repo.  This is done by running: 

```
git clone git@github.com:vallard/EKS-Training.git
```

You may instead wish to [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repo so you can make modifications. 

I work on a MacBook Pro and have a directory called `~/Code` where I do my work.  Any new repositories I download, I do the following: 

```
cd ~/Code
git clone git@github.com:vallard/EKS-Training.git
cd EKS-Training
```
Then I am able to use all the code in this repository.
