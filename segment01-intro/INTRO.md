Kubernetes has taken over the container management world. What used to be PaaS vendors have turned into opinionated Kubernetes vendors (Pivotal, OpenShift, VMware, etc. )

Other options championed by cloud vendors, even like the mighty AWS (fargate, ECS), have been steamrolled over by Kubernetes. 

Even the granddaddy, Docker, the company that started this revolution of using containers to deliver applications, has failed to be meaningful anymore in the world of managing the solution they came up with. 

Kubernetes today at the beginning of the roaring 20s is the technology to learn, and what better place to learn it than on the largest public cloud provider there is: AWS. 

This course takes us through provisioning a cluster on EKS, running applications on the cluster, setting up common infrastructure requirements, managing the lifecycle of the cluster, and finally integrating with other AWS services, including: API Gateway+Lambda in a serverless way, and DynamoDB databases.
